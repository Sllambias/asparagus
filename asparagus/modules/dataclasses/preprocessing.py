    Normalization:
        Supply a list of normalization operations with one entry per modality. E.g. ["volume_wise_znorm", "no_norm"]
        if the first modality should be normalized and the second should remain untouched
        - as is often the case if segmentations are used as training data
    Output dimensions:
        By default this will be defined by the target spacing. This means preprocessed data will often vary in
        height, width and depth dimensions.
        If uniform dimensions are desired set target_spacing to None and use target_size instead.
        Optionally with keep_aspect_ratio_when_using_target_size set to true if aspect ratio is important.
        This will introduce black bars in some dimensions to achieve specific dimensions without compromising aspect ratio.
